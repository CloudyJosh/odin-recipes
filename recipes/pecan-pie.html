<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
      Pecan pie is the classic sugary dessert without which no Thanksgiving is complete.<br>

     It’s as traditional as pumpkin pie and as wonderfully rich as apple pie. Growing up,<br>

      my family’s Thanksgiving dessert table always included (and will always include) my late grandmother’s old fashioned pecan pie recipe.<br>

       It’s a true honor to share her recipe and I hope this recipe lives on forever in her memory.

</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Pecans: Can’t prepare this filling without pecans!</li>
    <li>Eggs: Eggs hold the filling together.</li>
    <li>Corn Syrup: Sweetens and helps prevent crystallization while the pie bakes.<br>
         I prefer dark corn syrup for intensified flavor. See below if you’re interested in pie without corn syrup.</li>
    <li>Brown Sugar: There’s 1 and 1/2 cups total sugar in this pie, which includes the brown sugar and corn syrup (1/2 cup and 1 cup). <br>
        Typically this pie has around 2 full cups, but I find that much too sweet.</li>
    <li>Salt + Butter + Vanilla Extract: Each give pecan pie its traditional flavor.</li>
    <li>Cinnamon: Cinnamon adds an extra layer of flavor! I don’t see many pecan pies with cinnamon– <br>
        so thank you, grandma, for giving me the opportunity to present a slightly unique pecan pie on our Thanksgiving tables.</li>
    
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Make the pie crust. As always, use my favorite homemade pie crust. This is the same crust you can use when making mini pecan pies too!</li><br>
    <li>Roll out the pie crust. You’re aiming for a pie dough circle 12 inches in diameter. Carefully place the dough into a 9-inch pie dish. Crimp or flute the pie crust edges.</li><br>
    <li>Spread the pecans inside pie crust.</li><br>
    <li>Whisk together remaining ingredients. Pour over pecans.</li><br>
    <li>Bake. I like to place a pie crust shield on top of the pie edges to prevent them from browning too quickly.<br>
        If you find the whole pie is browning too quickly, tent a piece of aluminum foil over the whole pie.</li><br>
    <li>Slice and serve. The pie is delicious warm or at room temperature. Top with whipped cream, ice cream, and/or a sprinkle of cinnamon-sugar.<br>
        Salted caramel would be great, too!</li>
