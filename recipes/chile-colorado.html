<h2>Description</h2>

   <p> You may hear the name “Chile Colorado” and think this is some sort of chili based out of the state of Colorado. Not quite!<br>
        Try reading the name of the dish again with your best Spanish accent; “Chile color-ado”…it takes on a different meaning!<br>
    Colorado in Spanish translates to “colored red,” so essentially Chile Colorado is a Mexican style stew made with a red chile sauce.

   <h2>Ingredients</h2>

   <ul>
        <li>4 dried ancho chiles , or pasilla or mulato</li>
        <li>5 dried guajillo chiles , or New Mexican chiles</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 small onion , chopped</li>
        <li>½ of a jalapeno , minced (optional, for more heat)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked Paprika</li>
        <li>2 ½ lbs stew meat , or cubed beef</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons flour</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons oil</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>Juice from 1 small lime</li>
        <li>Cornstarch slurry (1 Tablespoon cornstarch mixed with 1 Tablespoon water)</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Steps</h2>

   <ol>
        <li>Remove meat from fridge and cut into ½ inch cubes. Set aside.</li><br>

        <li>Remove the stems (and seeds if you want, for milder heat) from the dried chiles while rinsing them under cold water.<br>
            Place chiles in a saucepan and cover with broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes.</li><br>

        <li>Meanwhile, prepare the meat. Season on all sides with salt and pepper and sprinkle with flour. Add oil to a skillet over medium high heat.<br>
             Once hot, add meat and cook until browned on both sides. Depending on the size of your pan you will need to do this in a few batches to keep from overcrowding.
        </li><br>

        <li>Remove meat to a plate and set aside. Add onion and jalapeno to the pan and saute for several minutes.</li><br>

        <li>As the onions cook, pour the softened peppers and the broth into a blender. Add the <br>sautéed onion and jalapeno and blend until smooth. Set aside.</li><br>

        <li>Return browned beef (and accumulated juices) back to the pot. Strain the chili sauce from the blender through a fine mesh strainer,<br> 
            into the pot. Add oregano, cumin, paprika, garlic powder and stir well. Add bay leaf.</li><br>

        <li>Bring to a slow boil, then reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for about an hour, or until the meat is very tender.</li><br>

        <li>Uncover and stir in lime juice and cornstarch slurry. Cook for a few more minutes, until the sauce has slightly thickened.</li><br>

        <li>Serve as a stew with tortillas for dipping and a side of Mexican rice and beans.</li><br>

   </ol>
