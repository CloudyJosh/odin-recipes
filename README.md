# odin-recipes
Hello, This project is a recipe website containing 3 unique recipes, Through the process of crafting this project I used many skills that I have learned from "The Odin Project".
In the process of making the website I used basic html code for example headers ("h1>Example Text/h1>") to present the names of the recipes, ("img src>")to add pictures to the website alongside ("alt>") text to provide accessibility for disabled users, I also used ("ul>" and "ol>") respectively to provide lists and steps for each recipe, in conclusion this project was a fantastic way to practice and hone my coding skills.<br>
